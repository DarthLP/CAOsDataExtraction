CAO 316 - ID 316002 - CAO_LMB_2013_2017_SZW_schoon_V3_20160530.json COMPARISON ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Here is a detailed data quality analysis of the extracted dataset against the manual dataset.

### **OVERALL ANALYSIS**

**CAO Number:** 316
**File ID:** 316002

The AI extraction shows significant discrepancies compared to the manually verified ground truth data. Key issues include a massive number of missed salary values, simplification of job group codes, and substantial differences in the content of descriptive text fields across all categories. The AI also introduced new fields not present in the manual dataset and missed several fields that were present.

---

### **1. WAGE INFORMATION COMPARISON**

**Missing Information:**
*   **Salary Values**: The AI failed to extract the vast majority of salary values. For each salary scale (`salary_1` through `salary_5`), the manual dataset contains 49-64 distinct values, whereas the extracted dataset only contains 9 values for each. This represents a critical loss of over 85% of the detailed wage scale data.
*   **Job Groups**: The detailed job group codes (e.g., "A-21-0", "B-22-3") are completely missing from the extracted data, having been replaced by simplified single letters.

**Additional Information:**
*   **salary_age_group**: The extracted dataset includes the field `salary_age_group` with the value "21 years and older", which is not in the manual dataset.
*   **more_salaries**: The extracted dataset includes the field `more_salaries` with the value "No", which is not in the manual dataset.

**Content Differences:**
*   **jobgroup**: The AI incorrectly simplified the job group codes.
    *   **Manual says**: A list of 64 specific codes like "A-21-0", "B-21-1", "C-23-5", etc.
    *   **Extracted says**: A list of 9 single-letter codes: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I".
    *   **FLAGGED AS DIFFERENCE** - The extracted data loses all specificity regarding age and service years.

*   **salary_5_startdate**: The day of the month is incorrect.
    *   **Manual says**: `2017-01-01 00:00:00`
    *   **Extracted says**: `02/01/2017`
    *   **FLAGGED AS DIFFERENCE**

*   **salary_increment Fields**: The format and data type are different.
    *   **salary_increment_1**: Manual `0.0125` (numeric), Extracted `"1.25%"` (string) - **FLAGGED AS DIFFERENCE**
    *   **salary_increment_2**: Manual `0.0125` (numeric), Extracted `"1.25%"` (string) - **FLAGGED AS DIFFERENCE**
    *   **salary_increment_3**: Manual `0.0175` (numeric), Extracted `"1.75%"` (string) - **FLAGGED AS DIFFERENCE**
    *   **salary_increment_5**: Manual `0.0075` (numeric), Extracted `"0.75%"` (string) - **FLAGGED AS DIFFERENCE**

*   **salary_note**: The content is completely different and does not align.
    *   **Manual says**: "The salary of the employee classified in one of the job groups is at least equal to the amount determined for his age or for his years of service, stated in the salary scales in Appendix 2,The wage scales always state the wage per hour, per four weeks and per month, The period wage is calculated by multiplying the amount per hour by factor 160 and the amount per month by multiplying the hourly wage by factor 174,"
    *   **Extracted says**: A different text about gross salary definition, non-rostered hours, adjustment for 22-year-olds, and entry-level wages.
    *   **FLAGGED AS DIFFERENCE**

### **2. PENSION INFORMATION COMPARISON**

**Missing Information:**
*   **age_group**: This field, containing information about pension premium adjustments for 2012-2013, is missing from the extracted data. While some of its content appears to have been merged into the `pension_premium_basic` field, the original field is absent.

**Additional Information:**
*   **pension_premium_plus**: The extracted dataset contains a detailed note on supplementary pension accrual and early retirement (VUT) schemes, which is not present in the manual dataset.

*   **retire_age_plus**: The extracted value is a text description instead of a number, and the content does not match.
    *   **Manual says**: `67`
    *   **Extracted says**: "Full-time employees can opt to work one day less per week for a maximum of one year before their pension starts. The VUT-eligible age for employees who were 55 or older on December 31, 2004, was gradually increased to 60 years and seven months between 2006 and 2010."

*   **probation_period**: The extracted text is a slightly rephrased and simplified version of the manual text.
    *   **Manual says**: "For each new employment contract longer than six months, a trial period of two months applies..."
    *   **Extracted says**: "For a new employment contract longer than six months, a two-month probationary period applies..."
