CAO 182 - ID 182001 - Horeca_cao__2018_2019_na_ttw.json COMPARISON ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Here is the data quality analysis for CAO Number 182, File ID 182001.

### **OVERALL ANALYSIS**

The AI extraction shows significant differences compared to the manual dataset. While some core information is captured, the AI often extracts more verbose, contextual information from the source text rather than the structured, specific data points found in the manual dataset. This leads to discrepancies in data type (e.g., text vs. number), completeness, and structure. Key issues include a completely missed salary table, different formatting for numerical values, and the extraction of long descriptive paragraphs where specific values are expected.
